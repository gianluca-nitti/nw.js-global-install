# nw.js-global-install
The aim of this project is to provide a fast way for users to launch [nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) based applications.
It will consist of a small executable (*nwjsmanager*) for Windows and Linux which will manage a cache of one or more nw.js versions in a common directory on the users' machines.
The project will define a new way for developers to package their nw.js apps (a boilerplate repository will be opened soon), without bundling the nw binaries with the application files; when a user install an application packaged in this format, the installer (NSIS or InnoSetup on Windows, or .deb/.rpm package on Linux) will look for *nwjsmanager* and extract it if it's not already present on the computer. Then when the user launches the application, *nwjsmanager* will check if there is a nw.js version compatible with the application in the cache folder; if a suitable version is found, the application will be launched using it, othervise the latest compatible version will be downloaded form http://dl.nwjs.io/ and put in the cache. This will avoid the 40MB+ nw.js download when the user installs another nw.js based application, speeding up the download&install process and saving hard drive space.
